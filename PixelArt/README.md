# Description  
This code uses the `pixart` module to draw pixel art based on user input. It includes a `draw` function that interprets characters in strings as colored pixels and a `main` function that prompts the user to select and render predefined pixel art designs. The user selects a drawing, which is then split into lines and processed to display the corresponding pixel art on the screen.
