# Description

The "pizza" code consists of classes and functions to create and customize pizzas. It utilizes the "pizza_toppings" module to manage toppings. The "Pizza" class represents a pizza object with attributes for cheese, veggies, meat, and price. It includes methods to set toppings, calculate price, and add toppings from the "pizza_toppings" module. The "pizza_main" code interacts with users to make two pizzas, prompting them to choose cheese, meat, and veggies. It calculates the total cost of both pizzas and displays the order details. Lastly, the "pizza_toppings" module defines the "Toppings" class, which provides methods to retrieve details of cheese, meat, and veggie toppings based on order codes.
