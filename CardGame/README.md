# Description
The `cards` file contains essential functions for handling a deck of cards, encompassing card creation, deck management, and gameplay mechanics. It provides methods to create individual cards with specific ranks and suits, construct a standard 52-card deck, shuffle the deck randomly, draw cards into a hand, deal cards between players, and play rounds of a card game, managing hand and deck updates throughout. On the other hand, the `idiots_delight` file utilizes the functionalities from `cards` to implement a card game known as "Idiot's Delight." It includes functions for dealing an initial hand, discarding cards from the hand, playing rounds of the game, and orchestrating the main function to run and manage the game's execution. Together, these files offer a comprehensive framework for both managing a deck of cards and playing a specific card game.
